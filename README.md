# AI_Development_Workflow#  Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction using AI

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after discharge. It follows the full **AI Development Workflow**, from data preprocessing to deployment.

---

##  Problem Statement

Hospital readmissions within 30 days can indicate poor care or discharge planning and are often avoidable. This project builds an AI model that predicts readmission risk based on patient data, allowing hospitals to prioritize follow-up care.

---

##  Objectives

- Predict patient readmission within 30 days using structured data
- Integrate model into a hospital system via API
- Address ethical concerns such as fairness and privacy
